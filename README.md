Requirements
In this application you will create a to-do list application that can do the following:
Users should be able to view all of the to-do tasks
Users should be able to add a to-do to the list of to-do tasks
Users should be able to mark a task as completed by crossing it out on click
Users should be able to remove to-do tasks by removing those elements from the DOM
The page should be aesthetically pleasing (aka be styled)
For now do not worry that your page resets during a refresh, making that work is a stretch goal.

If you don't know where to begin, here's the recommended path:

Start by adding the HTML code. This is like the skeleton of the page, so add a title, list, form, input, buttons, etc...
Add your JavaScript
Create a variable that will hold your to-do list items.
Add a function that takes in a string as input and adds it to the to-do list.
Add an event handler to populate an HTML element with your to-do list when the user clicks the appropriate button.
Etc... break down the big problems into baby steps and solve them systematically. Test as you go.
With the main functionality in place, style your HTML elements using CSS. Make use of the developer console for testing styling.
Finished with the main objectives? Continue on to the stretch goals to make your application even better.
